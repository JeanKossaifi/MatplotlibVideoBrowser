# MatplotlibVideoBrowser
Using [Matplotlib's GUI Neutral widgets](http://matplotlib.org/api/widgets_api.html) to through the frames of videos.

This is merely an example of how to easily use Matplotlib to create quickly a simple tool.
Here I needed to be able to quickly browse through some videos I annotated, ie visualise both the image and their facial landmarks.

## Can I see?

## Can I try?
Sure, all you need is python3, matplotlib, numpy and scipy (everyone has that, right?)
Just clone the repository and run 
```
python3 browser.py
```
